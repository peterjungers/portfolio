            Hello! My name is Peter Jungers, and I am a web developer with full stack skills. This is my portfolio! I have a special interest in creating sites that are intuitive in their usability,
            yet retain a sense of discovery. I have a keen sense of structure and organization, as well as attention to detail. I apply these skills not only when designing for the user, but also when
            writing transparent and maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical knowledge, I have backgrounds in graphic design and public education. My design skills merge seamlessly with web development; my time in education has been
            integral in allowing me to exercise the artistry of collaboration and intellectual cultivation. I enjoy the process of working as a team, and I thrive in the joyful solitude of the world
            within the computer. All these skills and more make me confident that I would be a valuable member of a web development team. I can be reached at <a href="#">peterjungers@gmail.com</a>, or
            via
            <a href="#">LinkedIn</a>. My code is viewable at <a href="#">GitHub</a>.
