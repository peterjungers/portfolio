            I use Flask and Django frameworks to create my full stack sites, all of which were built from scratch and are fully responsive. I am especially interested in creating practical, dynamic sites, where information can be found readily and intuitively. I had a lot of fun working on these projects!

                The Damon & Felix Die-Cast Racing League, of which I am a board member, team manager, and lead statistician, is a high-performance die-cast racing league, comprised primarily of Hot Wheels vehicles, but with a healthy showing from Matchbox. Each season culminates in the Champions League, where twelve vehicles compete to be the league champion. More information about the workings of the league are found on the <a href="#">site itself</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been keeping stats of various kinds for the league since its first season, primarily using Google Sheets, which helped inspire the look and functionality of the new site. My other inspiration came from
                <a href="#">my first Python project</a>, which was a searchable database that directly inspired the vehicles stats search on the new site. My primary goal in creating the site was not only to have a historical record of the league, but to create functionality for team managers to better track their vehicles.
