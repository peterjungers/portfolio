            I use Flask and Django frameworks to create my full stack sites, all of which were built from scratch and are fully responsive. I am especially interested in creating practical, dynamic sites, where information can be found readily and intuitively. I had a lot of fun working on these projects!

                The Damon & Felix Die-Cast Racing League, of which I am a board member, team manager, and lead statistician, is a high-performance die-cast racing league, comprised primarily of Hot Wheels vehicles, but with a healthy showing from Matchbox. Each season culminates in the Champions League, where twelve vehicles compete to be the league champion. More information about the workings of the league are found on the <a href="#">site itself</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been keeping stats of various kinds for the league since its first season, primarily using Google Sheets, which helped inspire the look and functionality of the new site. My other inspiration came from
                <a href="#">my first Python project</a>, which was a searchable database that directly inspired the vehicles stats search on the new site. My primary goal in creating the site was not only to have a historical record of the league, but to create functionality for team managers to better track their vehicles.

                Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch contains, to date, 72 tracks spread over 18 cups. The goal of my Cup Generator is to expand upon these original cups by constructing new ones based on thematic similarities across tracks throughout the game. For example, a number of tracks are set in the sky; others take place within large buildings. I therefore created a database of the tracks in the game, determined what the new thematic cups would be, then constructed the user interface to allow the easy viewing of these new cups. Like with the DFDRL project, I wanted to create a site that I could use. The site is updated and expanded every few months as Nintendo releases new tracks for the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was my second Flask project, and first that was completely independent. My <a href="#">first Flask site</a>, though necessarily containing unique SQLAlchemy queries, relied heavily on tutorials for its HTML and CSS. With the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Cup Generator, however, I became more comfortable and confident with all aspects of the framework, a trend that continues with each subsequent project I work on..
