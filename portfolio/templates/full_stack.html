            I use Flask and Django frameworks to create my full stack sites, all of which were built from scratch and are fully responsive. I am especially interested in creating practical, dynamic sites, where information can be found readily and intuitively. I had a lot of fun working on these projects!

                The Damon & Felix Die-Cast Racing League, of which I am a board member, team manager, and lead statistician, is a high-performance die-cast racing league, comprised primarily of Hot Wheels vehicles, but with a healthy showing from Matchbox. Each season culminates in the Champions League, where twelve vehicles compete to be the league champion. More information about the workings of the league are found on the <a href="#">site itself</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been keeping stats of various kinds for the league since its first season, primarily using Google Sheets, which helped inspire the look and functionality of the new site. My other inspiration came from
                <a href="{{ url_for('python', _anchor='ddrl-champions-league') }}">my first Python project</a>, which was a searchable database that directly inspired the vehicles stats search on the new site. My primary goal in creating the site was not only to have a historical record of the league, but to create functionality for team managers to better track their vehicles.

                Wanting to create a web app based on my earlier Python <a href="{{ url_for('python', _anchor='smb-quiz') }}">quiz project</a>, I used the opportunity to become more familiar with the Django web framework. Like the Python project before it, the web-based version of the quiz contains ten questions chosen randomly from a larger database. In order to write the questions and make the pixel art, I had to do substantial research (i.e., play the games a whole bunch). The quiz is designed to be something one would want to return to: the questions are generally moderately difficult, no correct answers are given upon an incorrect answer, and the database of questions is large enough (but small enough) to encourage repeat attempts. I used the awesome web app <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com" target="_blank">Piskel</a> to make the pixel art.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was my first project in Django after learning the framework via tutorials. Although my familiarity with Django is not on par with Flask, I now feel more knowledgeable of its overall file structure, ORM syntax, and its general capabilities and features. In addition to being a Django project, the quiz site became equally an exercise in JavaScript, where randomizing images and adding stylistic touches helped to create the user experience I had hoped for.

                Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch contains, to date, 72 tracks spread over 18 cups. The goal of my Cup Generator is to expand upon these original cups by constructing new ones based on thematic similarities across tracks throughout the game. For example, a number of tracks are set in the sky; others take place within large buildings. I therefore created a database of the tracks in the game, determined what the new thematic cups would be, then constructed the user interface to allow the easy viewing of these new cups. Like with the DFDRL project, I wanted to create a site that I could use. The site is updated and expanded every few months as Nintendo releases new tracks for the game.

                This was my second Flask project, and first that was completely independent. My <a href="https://github.com/peterjungers/afc_west_records" target="_blank">first Flask site</a>, though necessarily containing unique SQLAlchemy queries, relied heavily on tutorials for its HTML and CSS. With the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Cup Generator, however, I became more comfortable and confident with all aspects of the framework, a trend that continues with each subsequent project I work on.

                The site you are visiting now is the culmination of over a year's worth of learning. Beginning in January of 2022, I began taking college courses related to computer programming, systems administration, TCP/IP, database design, SQL, and, finally, web development. In addition to these college courses, I taught myself the Flask and Django web frameworks using web resources, along with any other skills, relating to any topic, that I felt I needed, or simply wanted, to understand. Throughout this learning process, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I was driven by a desire not just to complete the tasks or assignments at hand, but to fully understand the reasons why things worked as they did, as well as the best practices associated with these tasks. My goal in this process was to gain the skills needed to start a new career in the world of technologyâ€”I now feel I have these skills. Web development combines my interests in programming, design, creativity, and collaboration, in a way nothing else ever has. I look forward to my new career!
